## HW 1: Problem 1
Create a data frame with a random sample of 10 with a uniform distribution, logical vector witih elements greater than 2, character vector and factor vector.

```{r data frame for problem 1}
hw1_q1_df = tibble(
  samp = runif(10, 0, 5),
  vec_logical = samp > 2,
  vec_character = c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'),
  vec_factor = factor(c(vec_character))
)
